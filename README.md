# About Me

I have participated in coding summer courses and had a tutor.

I have an interest in coding because I feel as though it is the future and it is also the language of modern times so I want to learn how to read and write it more fluently.

Some of my Interests include history, chemistry, reading, video games, and tennis

Some Goals I have for this class include being able to fluently understand and write basic code. I would like to try to create a top-down PVE tank game.
